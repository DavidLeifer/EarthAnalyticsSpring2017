## R Markdown
`here is some code`
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Code Chunks

```{r chunk-name-with-no-spaces}
# code goes here
```

### Basic Maths

```{r perform-math }
# perform addition
a <- 1+2

b <- 234

# subtract a from b
final_answer <- b - a

# write out the final answer variable
final_answer
```

```{r math-part-two }

   # More math!
   a * b

   a * b / final_answer
```

```{r intro-option, eval=FALSE}
# this is a comment. text, next to a comment, is not processed by R
# comments will appear on your rendered r markdown document
1+2
```

### Challenge

```{r Boulder precip data}
# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# download data from figshare
# note that we are downloading  the data into your working directory (earth-analytics)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681",
              destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file="data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)

# when we download the data we create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using it's name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot our data
qplot(x=boulder_precip$DATE,
      y=boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```
